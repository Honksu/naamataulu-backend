Here's the instructions how to currently run the backend:

clear the database at use and set it properly in settings.py

start the server

go to api/v1/users and create a user with null features and null implementer(proper user creation is TODO)

go to api/v1/test and enroll an image to the database, this overrides the existing user's features and implementer

go to run api/v1/test and recognise with a different image of the same person, the response should be 200 OK

if you have server console, the distance between the user in the database and the image to be recognised is printed
